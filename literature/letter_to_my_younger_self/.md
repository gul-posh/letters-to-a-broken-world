# letter to my younger self

dear little one,  

there are things no one will tell you — not because they don't love you, but because they don't know either. you will spend years building bridges you were never meant to cross, stitching words into broken skies, and wondering why it feels like you are always holding your breath.

i will not lie to you: it will be lonely sometimes. the world will not always be kind to the ones who feel too much, think too much, love too much. but hold on to that stubborn softness — it will be the rarest thing you have.

trust the silence.  
trust the long hours spent with books no one else reads.  
trust the words you scribble on the backs of receipts and forgotten notebooks.  
trust the equations that make no sense yet somehow feel inevitable.  

you will find that sadness and beauty are siblings. you will find that failure often looks exactly like becoming.

and one day —  
not when you expect it, and not loudly —  
you will look back and realize: you built a life from the things you were told would ruin you.

please don't be in such a hurry to outgrow yourself.  
the world is large, yes — but the small, quiet self you are right now is already infinite.

i am so proud of you.

love,  
the future you (still learning)
