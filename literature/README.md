# literature

time was invented by clock companies to sell more clocks.  
words were invented by lonely souls to find their way back to one another.

this folder is a quiet rebellion against noise — a place where language slows down, forgets its obligations, and remembers how to dream.

## the spirit of this place

this is not a library; it is a weathered bench under an old tree.  
the pieces here are not perfect, nor do they try to be.  
they are scraps, fragments, echoes — stitched together by hope, doubt, and fleeting wonder.

each word is an unfinished conversation with the world:  
a letter sent without expectation of a reply.

## inspiration

sometimes, the universe speaks in mathematics;  
sometimes, it weeps through poetry.

this project lives in the thin, flickering space between calculation and confession —  
where diplomacy meets silence, and literature meets longing.

to write is to believe, foolishly and stubbornly, that broken things are still worth mending.

## navigation

you can explore freely:

- start with a poem if you seek rhythm.
- start with an essay if you seek questions.
- start with a metaphor if you seek mirrors.

there are no beginnings or endings here — only crossroads.

## notes

everything here is a work in progress.  
edits may come years later, or never at all.  
like abandoned ships, some ideas may drift too far to retrieve — and that, too, will be part of the story.
